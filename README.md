# EnglishDictionary
##### Simple Interactive English Dictionary based on Udemy's course "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications" by Ardit. Two versions: one stores data in a .json file, the other on an SQL database. 

Additional changes I've made: 
- get_close_matches -> ask user for guesses multiple times (max number of similar matches = 3)
- (TO FINISH) add the controls from .json implementation to the SQL version
